# Contributing to "Awesome Event Driven Architecture"

Please note that the list is **highly curated**. The aspiration is to assemble resources that excel in providing clarity around the principles and terminology. As a whole, the collection should provide a comprehensive and consistent overview of the topic. In the spirit of the [Awesome Lists Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md): _"Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything."_


Of course if you think something that belongs in the list is missing, you can suggest its inclusion in an [issue](https://github.com/reactivesystems-eu/awesome-event-driven-architecture/issues) or [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
