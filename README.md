### Fundamentals

- [Core Decisions in Event-Driven Architecture](https://youtu.be/SKXS2h3MdPM?si=LeamTGy93vAy2QYc) by Duana Stanley, October 2019. Overall a great talk, definitely worth watching. Some minor issues:
    - The advice to use ids in events to refer to other entities is not wrong, but needs deeper discussion. 
    - I don't like the term "command events", something is either a command or an event.
    - In the end she hints at Kafka as an event store, I don't think that's good idea. 

- [Event-Driven Architectures Done Right](https://youtu.be/A_mstzRGfIE?si=An0YI1034-PazFc5) by Tim Berglund, May 2021.



### Experience Reports And Practicalities


- [EDA in Practice: Building an eCommerce Platform at Cinch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-dTroS0FA&t=493s) by Toli Apostolidis, September 2022. You can ignore the first 8 minutes and 15 seconds (in fact the link will skip them), they are mostly promotion for AWS. But from there on follows a good talk on real-world experiences with event-driven architecture.




## Addendum

Please note that the list is **highly curated**. The aspiration is to assemble resources that excel in providing clarity around the principles and terminology. As a whole, the collection should provide a comprehensive and consistent overview of the topic. In the spirit of the [Awesome Lists Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md): _"Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything."_


Of course if you think something that belongs in the list is missing, you can suggest its inclusion in an [issue](https://github.com/reactivesystems-eu/awesome-event-driven-architecture/issues) or [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
